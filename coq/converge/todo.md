# Facts remaining:
* Prove that `Finite A -> Finite B -> Finite ( A -> B)` and it's dependent analogue. This helps us cut down on hypotheses where we assume that the set of decision rules is also finite/nonempty. 
* Prove that the sets of the form `{f | f <= g}` are closed sets in the topology of the Rmax norm. 
* Prove the law of total expectaion and the "take out what is known" property of conditional expectations. 
* Prove a version of contraction coinduction. 
* Use contraction coinduction to prove Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 of the LTV paper. This should prove that there is a policy (called the greedy policy) whose long term value is equal to the fixed point.
* Prove that the fixed point is actually the max value function over all policies. 
* Prove the policy improvement theorem. 
* Set up the turtle example.
